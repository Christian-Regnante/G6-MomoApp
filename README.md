# Updated README.md
## Project Description

The G6 MomoApp processes MoMo SMS data in XML format, cleans and categorizes transactions, stores them in a relational database, and provides a frontend dashboard for analysis and visualization. This project demonstrates backend data processing, database management, and frontend visualization skills.

## Folder Structure

- **/docs**: Contains the ERD diagram and other documentation files.
- **/database**: Contains SQL scripts for database creation and management.
- **/examples**: Contains JSON files with sample data for testing and development.
- **README.md**: This file, providing an overview of the project.

## Database Design

The database schema is designed to efficiently store and manage transaction data. The ERD diagram in the `/docs` folder illustrates the relationships between the entities involved.

## Setup and Usage

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/G6_MomoApp.git
