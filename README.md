>**System Architecture**

The application is organized into four main layers:
1. **Data Source**: Raw XML files containing MoMo SMS data.  
2. **ETL Pipeline**: Scripts to parse XML, clean/normalize data, categorize transactions, and load results into a relational database.  
3. **Storage**: SQLite database storing structured transaction data.  
4. **Frontend Dashboard**: Static HTML/CSS/JS interface (or optional API) that visualizes processed data.
